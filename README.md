# Helloooooooo There ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm part of a community of coders who code for fun and embrace the joy of creation and learning.  <br>
I'm focusing on exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I'm also a chess player tho' <br> not very good, just a beginner, I guess. But yeah, I love both of them.

## My Favorite Chess Opening

I really love playing the King's Indian Defense due to its ability to gather more materials <br>
while avoiding blunders, with a solid and flexible pawn structure, making it a robust opening <br>
despite its drawback <br>

## Here's some poetry written by ChatGPT

```
In the shadow of the moon's embrace,
Whispered secrets find their place.
A dance of hearts, both lost and found,
In love's silence, we are bound.

A blade of fate, sharp and true,
Cuts the ties that bind us two.

Yet in the blood and tear-streaked night,
We find our souls take flight.

For in the death of love's sweet song,
Our spirits merge, forever strong.
An endless kiss, a final breath,
Together, even in death.
```
